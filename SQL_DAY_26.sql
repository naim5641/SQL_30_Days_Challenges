Question:

Suppose you are given two tables - Orders and Returns. 
The Orders table contains information about orders placed by customers, 
and the Returns table contains information about returned items. 

Design a SQL query to 
find the top 5 ustomer with the highest percentage 
of returned items out of their total orders. 
	
Return the customer ID 
and the percentage of returned items rounded to two decimal places.
